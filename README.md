## Introduction
With the continuous development of science and technology, the application of robotics in the industrial field has gradually become a key factor to promote production efficiency and quality improvement. Among them, the application of weld grinding automation has brought significant changes to the industrial field. Robotic weld grinding automation is the use of advanced machine learning, visual recognition, and motion control techniques to enable robots to accurately perceive the position and shape of the weld and automatically execute the grinding process. 
To this end, we developed a new transformation segmentation algorithm to solve the problem of weld segmentation in smoke environment.
